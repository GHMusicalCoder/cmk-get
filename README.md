# cmk-get
My personal installer program based on deb-get.  Used for zips and tars or other non-deb applications.  
Will be used to install and update non-deb / non-flatpak programs.
This is currently only for ubuntu systems.

### current programs 
- bw-cli (Bitwarden CLI program from GitHub)
- btop++ (Github make)
- g910-keys (Logitech g910 Keyboard extra GKeys mapper)
- sweet dark theme
- candy icons
- sweet folders

### assumptions
- uses sudo (not doas or as SU [root])
- ubuntu base system (so Ubuntu or UMate, UBudgie, etc)
  - because of this, I don't care about arch as I'm only install on intel/amd cpu's
  - nor do I care about releases,  versions, or the ID of the OS
